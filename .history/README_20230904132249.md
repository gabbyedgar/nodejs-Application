# Square and Sum Numbers

This Node.js script calculates the sum of the squares of numbers in an array and then finds the square root of the sum.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
```

   ```
   cd square-and-sum-numbers
   ```

3. Open the `index.js` file to view the code.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

   This script will perform the following steps:

   - Create an array of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
   - Square each number in the array.
   - Calculate the sum of the squared values.
   - Find the square root of the sum.

5. You will see the following output in the terminal:

   ```
   Squared numbers:
   ┌─────────┬───────┐
   │ (index) │ Values │
   ├─────────┼───────┤
   │    0    │   1   │
   │    1    │   4   │
   │    2    │   27  │
   │    3    │  256  │
   │    4    │  3125 │
   │    5    │ 46656 │
   │    6    │ 823543│
   └─────────┴───────┘
   Sum of squares: 831812
   Square rooted sum of squares: 911.5328162514266

6. The script uses a pure function to calculate the square of a number and higher-order functions like `map` and `reduce` for data transformation.
